µReticulum — LoRa board pinout presets
======================================
Hardware-fixed pinouts for SX126x SPI LoRa boards, defined once and referenced
by name from config.py:

    {
        "type": "LoRaInterface",
        "board": "esp32s3_cam_sx1262",   # pinout preset (this file)
        "name": "LoRa",
        "enabled": True,
        # network/radio params live in config.py, shared across all nodes:
        "freq_khz": 868800, "sf": 8, "bw": "125", "coding_rate": 5,
        "tx_power": 14, "preamble_len": 8, "crc_en": True, "syncword": 0x1424,
    }

A preset holds ONLY values that are fixed by the board's wiring:
  spi_bus, sck_pin, mosi_pin, miso_pin, cs_pin, busy_pin, dio1_pin, reset_pin,
  dio2_rf_sw, dio3_tcxo_millivolts, and optionally use_dcdc / spi_baudrate.

Radio/network parameters (freq, sf, bw, coding_rate, tx_power, syncword, …) are
NOT board-specific — they must match across every node on the mesh — so they
stay in the interface entry in config.py.

A preset may also carry an optional "battery" block describing this board's
battery-voltage sense, resolved by battery_config() and read by
peripherals/adc_reader.py:

    "battery": {"pin": 1, "divider": 2.0},   # ADC GPIO, vbat = vpin * divider

Omit it on boards with no battery->ADC path — e.g. the XIAO ESP32-S3, which has
none (Meshtastic itself ships that board with battery monitoring disabled). An
inline CONFIG["battery"] dict overrides the preset's block, same as the pins.

To add a board: copy a block below, rename the key, and set its pins. Any key
you also set in the interface entry overrides the preset (handy for one-off
tweaks without editing this file).
